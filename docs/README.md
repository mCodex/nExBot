## ⚡ Performance Tips

> [!IMPORTANT]
> nExBot is optimized for performance, but here are some tips to maximize it:

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand performance tips</b></summary>

### ✅ Do's

- Keep your creature list focused (don't add unnecessary monsters)
- Use the recommended macro intervals (don't make them faster)
- Close unnecessary game windows
- Keep your backpack organized

### ❌ Don'ts

- Don't enable features you don't need
- Don't set extremely low intervals on macros
- Don't run multiple heavy scripts at once
- Don't have hundreds of waypoints in one script

</details>

## 🖥️ Multi-Client Support

> [!TIP]
> nExBot supports running multiple clients with independent configurations!

### Per-Character Profile Persistence

Each character automatically remembers their own active profiles. When you run multiple clients simultaneously, each character loads their own saved configuration.

**How It Works:**
- Profiles are saved per-character in `character_profiles.json`
- When you select a profile, it's saved for **your current character**
- On login, each character's profiles are restored **before** the UI loads
- No manual switching needed - just log in and your settings are ready!

### Per-Character Profile Persistence

Each character remembers their own active profiles:

| Bot | Profile Type | Stored As |
|-----|--------------|-----------|
| **HealBot** | Profile 1-5 | Number |
| **AttackBot** | Profile 1-5 | Number |
| **CaveBot** | Config name | String |
| **TargetBot** | Config name | String |

### How It Works

1. When you select a profile on any bot, it's saved for **your character**
2. When you log into a different character, **their last used profiles** are restored
3. Profiles are stored in `character_profiles.json`

### Example

```json
{
  "CharacterA": {
    "healProfile": 2,
    "attackProfile": 3,
    "cavebotProfile": "Dragon_Darashia",
    "targetbotProfile": "Dragons"
  },
  "CharacterB": {
    "healProfile": 1,
    "attackProfile": 1,
    "cavebotProfile": "Hydra_Oramond",
    "targetbotProfile": "Hydras"
  }
}
```
